# Emu
An emu can run pretty fast!
## What is Emu?
Emu is a programming language for writing performant code. Emu shouldn't be used on its own, but rather as part of a project written primarily in a language such as C or C++. Emu is a great choice for writing the "hotpath" of your application.
## How far along is Emu?
Emu is still being designed.
