# Emu
Emu is a simple systems language ala C. Emu is built from Haskell, C++, and LLVM.
## How far along is Emu?
Emu is "complete" in the sense that I've implemented all the features I set out to implement when I started the project. If I feel like adding more (a good module system, comptime arguments, etc.), I will, but no promises.

- [x] Basic CLI interface
- [x] Parser & AST
- [x] Semantic analysis
- [x] Haskell to C++ marshalling
- [x] LLVM code generation
- [x] Fleshed out command line interface
- [x] Comptime evaluator
- [x] Full language semantic checking
- [x] Core language feature-set
- [ ] Good documentation
