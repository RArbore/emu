An emu can run pretty fast!
## What is Emu?
Emu is a programming language for writing performant code. Emu is a systems language ala C & Zig.
## How far along is Emu?
Emu has reached minimal viability. Not every feature is implemented yet, but Emu is already a decently capable language. The emu compiler uses Haskell, C++, and LLVM.
